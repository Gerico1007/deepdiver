% Musical Encoding: Sprint 2 - Browser Persistence Victory
%
% This melody celebrates the achievement of persistent browser sessions,
% enabling seamless workflow without re-authentication between commands.
%
% Movement 1 (G-D-Em-C): Persistent Connection
%   - Flowing triplets represent continuous browser state
%   - No closing cadence in first movement = browser stays open
%   - G major establishes stability, D provides forward motion
%
% Movement 2 (Am-D7-G): Session Awareness
%   - Rising melody captures notebook tracking (3 notebooks!)
%   - D7 dominant seventh creates expectation
%   - G major resolution = active notebook context achieved
%
% Movement 3 (C-G-D-G): Seamless Workflow
%   - Ascending then resolving = create→list→status flow
%   - Final sustained G (g6) = persistent state achieved
%   - Triple meter reflects three-part workflow completion
%
% Tempo: Andante sostenuto (sustained and flowing)
% Dynamics: Legato throughout (connected, unbroken like our session)
% Character: Triumphant yet serene - stable persistence
%
% Achievements Encoded in This Sprint:
% - Browser stays alive between commands ✅
% - Session state persists across operations ✅
% - 3 notebooks tracked successfully in one session ✅
% - No re-authentication needed ✅
% - Active notebook context maintained ✅
%
% Technical Victories:
% - Removed automator.close() from all commands
% - Added session close command for manual cleanup
% - Enhanced session status with notebook tracking
% - Browser connection reused seamlessly
%
% Bugs Fixed During Sprint:
% - Logger initialization order (before config load)
% - Missing SessionTracker notebook methods
% - Session schema missing notebooks array
% - notebooks_count error in get_session_status()
%
% Test Results:
% - ✅ deepdiver notebook create (browser stays open)
% - ✅ deepdiver notebook list (3 notebooks shown)
% - ✅ deepdiver session status (active notebook tracked)
% - ✅ All methods functional, no crashes
