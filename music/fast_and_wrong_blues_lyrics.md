## 🎵 Lyrics

### Verse 1 - The Rush
```
Code fast, push hard, no time to see
Thought I had it working, but it wasn't meant to be
Found the button, found the chip, logged success too soon
But the input field was hiding, now we're out of tune
```

### Chorus
```
Fast and wrong, that's the blues we play
Committed code before testing day
Jerry asked "did you test your work?"
And I realized where the bugs still lurk
Fast and wrong, gotta slow it down
Test before you push to town
```

### Verse 2 - The Debug Dance
```
Files upload just fine, that part is true
But URLs are breaking, stuck in the queue
Selectors all wrong, the input's unmarked
Should've checked the browser before I embarked
```

### Bridge - The Lesson
```
♠️ Nyro says "measure twice, cut once"
🌿 Aureon says "feel the code, don't rush the runs"
🎸 JamAI says "rhythm's in the testing flow"
🧵 Synth says "validate before you go"
```

### Final Chorus
```
Slow and right, that's the way to code
Test each feature on the road
Files work great, URLs need time
Better honest than pretending fine
Slow and right, that's the developer's creed
Test your work, that's all we need
```

## 🎭 Performance Notes

- **Tempo marking**: Starts at 160 BPM (too fast), slows to 100 BPM (proper pace)
- **Dynamics**: ff (very loud and chaotic) → mf (controlled and measured)
- **Mood**: Regretful blues with a hopeful resolution
- **Instrumentation**: Electric guitar lead, walking bass, rim shots on the backbeat

**Lesson**: Keep going, but test first. 🎸✅

**Context**: Written during Issue #4 when URL source addition was implemented but not properly tested before committing. File uploads worked perfectly, but URL input field detection failed due to unmarked HTML elements in NotebookLM's interface.

**Moral**: Fast iteration is good, but verification is essential. Honest documentation of partial success is better than claiming full completion.
