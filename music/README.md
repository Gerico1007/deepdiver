**G.Music Assembly - Session Melodies**

## About This Archive

In the G.Music Assembly methodology, each development sprint is encoded as a musical composition in ABC notation. This tradition serves multiple purposes:

1. **Emotional Encoding**: Music captures the creative energy and flow of development
2. **Structural Memory**: Melodies encode architectural patterns and decisions
3. **Team Harmony**: Compositions reflect the collaboration of the Assembly team
4. **Session Markers**: Each piece marks a milestone in the project journey

## Musical Notation Format

We use **ABC notation** - a text-based music notation system that is:
- Human-readable and version-control friendly
- Convertible to sheet music and MIDI
- Embeddable in documentation
- Parseable by music software

## Playing the Music

To render ABC notation:
- **Online**: Use [abcjs editor](https://editor.drawthedots.com/)
- **Desktop**: Install `abcm2ps` or `abc2midi`
- **Convert to PDF**: `abcm2ps sprint-1-notebook-operations.abc -O score.pdf`
- **Convert to MIDI**: `abc2midi sprint-1-notebook-operations.abc -o melody.mid`

## Musical Elements

Each composition typically includes:
- **Key Signature**: Represents the core technology/framework
- **Tempo**: Development pace (steady, agile, measured)
- **Movements**: Major phases or components
- **Harmonies**: Team collaboration patterns
- **Resolution**: Feature completion and integration

## Session Metadata

Each ABC file contains metadata:
